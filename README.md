# RPS_Game

This time, I only used javascript to make a rock, paper, scissor game as The Odin Project describes.

Next time, try to edit this game as a game that use buttons and visual effects.

(2nd version. Revised 8/28/23)
made button interactive game, but still need to edit for advanced performance.
